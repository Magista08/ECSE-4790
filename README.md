## Description

Basically, these are all codes including the code written by the Prof. Wilt and the code written by me and my teammate Thomas. 

## Usage

1. main code

   - Except the code in the `src` file, the other codes are written by the prof and cannot be changed. If you are also a part of the student who take this course, all codes you need to write is in the `src` code. 
   - The name of the folder is `LAB-0x`, i.e. LAB-01. The folder named`LAB-0x-Template_SD_JPEG_DMA` is Lab 06 and the folder named `CryptographyLabTemplate` is Lab07.

   - For the first two or three labs, I don't know how to hide some part of the files to run. As a result, all the codes is in the `main.c` file. If you don't understand. Please see the comment (Maybe the first lab's comment is too messy, I am sorry :>)

   - For the last labs, the code is separated by tasks. If you want to use different tasks or different functions, all I write is to use different `void function` .
   - **PLEASE NOTIFY DON'T COPY THE CODE HERE. EVERY YEAR, THE PROFESSOR WILL CHANGE TASKS SLIGHTLY!!!! READ THE PDF FILE IN THE FOLDER BEFORE YOU WANT TO USE THE CODE!!!**

2. Problems

   - For the last two labs, I did not finished yet. For the `lab 06` , I finished the first two function. For the `last lab`, I finished the first function and the second one is not satisfied.
